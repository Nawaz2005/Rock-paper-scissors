How the game works:-
The game will ask the player to choose either Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer will randomly select one of the three options as its choice.
The game will determine the winner based on the choices made:
Rock crushes Scissors (Rock wins against Scissors).
Scissors cuts Paper (Scissors wins against Paper).
Paper covers Rock (Paper wins against Rock).
If both the player and computer choose the same option, it's a tie.
Display the result (win, lose, or tie) and ask if the player wants to play again.
